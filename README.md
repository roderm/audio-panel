# React Panel for Pioneer VSX930

I've got a VSX-930 in my room and setted up for 5.1 and HD-Zone setup. With ther remote and the mobile-app it is really awful to controll this areas synced or per se.

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic controll (vol, power, etc) by test files
- [ ] Show updates in React Component (websocket)
- [ ] Update from frontend to Pioneer
- [ ] Support Szenes and scheduled actions
- [ ] Create "sync"-properties to bring both areas to same state and keep it
- [ ] gRPC api (android app)
- [ ] Config-page for "new zones" => possible?
- [ ] include snapcast devices in panel
